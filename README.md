## Introduction
Extended Sail provides local Docker-based development for Laravel, compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Except for Docker, you don't need to install any programs or libraries on your local machine before using Sail. Sail's simple command line interface means you can start building your Laravel application without any previous Docker experience.

Based on [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail)

#### Inspiration

It was decided to do Extended Sail in view of the lack of support from the authors of outdated versions of laravel, as well as php 7.2, php 7.3.

## Official Documentation
